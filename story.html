        <h1>DOOM's development(Classic series 1992-1997.)</h1>
        <p>
          The development of the original Doom started in 1992, when John Carmack developed a new game engine,
          the Doom engine, while the rest of the id Software team finished the Wolfenstein 3D prequel,
          Spear of Destiny. The game launched in an episodic format in 1993,
          with the first episode available as shareware and two more episodes available by mail order.
          The first episode was largely designed by John Romero. The title proved extremely popular,
          with the full version of the game selling one million copies.
          The term "Doom clone" became the name for new genre now known as first-person shooters for several years.

            Doom II: Hell on Earth was released in 1994 in a commercial format. Only minor changes were made at a technical level; the game featured new enemies, a new "Super Shotgun" weapon, and more complex levels. The game was followed by an expansion in 1995, titled Master Levels for Doom II, which added 20 additional levels. A fourth episode was added to the original game by the 1995 re-release.
