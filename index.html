          <h1>WHAT IS DOOM FRANCHISE?</h1>
          <p>
            Doom (stylized as DOOM) is an American media franchise created by
            John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud, and Tom
            Hall. The series usually focuses on the exploits of an unnamed space
            marine (often referred to as Doomguy or Doom Slayer) operating under
            the auspices of the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), who fights
            hordes of demons and the undead to save Earth from an apocalyptic
            invasion

            You've come here for a reason. The Union Aerospace Corporation's
            massive research facility on Mars is overwhelmed by fierce and
            powerful demons, and only one person stands between their world and
            ours. As the lone DOOM Marine, you've been activated to do one thing
            - kill them all.

          <h1>DOOM's development.</h1>
          <p>
            The development of the original Doom started in 1992, when John
            Carmack developed a new game engine, the Doom engine, while the rest
            of the id Software team finished the Wolfenstein 3D prequel, Spear
            of Destiny. The game launched in an episodic format in 1993, with
            the first episode available as shareware and two more episodes
            available by mail order. The first episode was largely designed by
            John Romero. The title proved extremely popular, with the full
            version of the game selling one million copies. The term "Doom
            clone" became the name for new genre now known as first-person
            shooters for several years.
